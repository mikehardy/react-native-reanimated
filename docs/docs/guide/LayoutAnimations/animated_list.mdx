On this page you can find step by step tutorial on how to use all types of Layout Animations:
- entering animation
- exiting animation
- layout transition

To give you a better understanding of how to use those animations, we are gonna use them on the quite
popular use case - list. We are gonna build a list of participants of some event. Users will be able to add
or remove people from the list.

<TutorialStep stepNumber="1">
    <div>
        Firstly, we are gonna build list without any animation. Let's start with creating new component with View and some basic styles.
    </div>
    <Step1/>
    
</TutorialStep>
<TutorialStep stepNumber="2">
    <div>
        Then we have to think about participant model. As we are building quite simple list, we will store only participant's name and id.
    </div>
    <Step2/>
</TutorialStep>
<TutorialStep stepNumber="3">
    <div>
        Do something
        Install something
    </div>
    <TutorialCode/>
    
</TutorialStep>
<TutorialStep stepNumber="4">
    <div>
        Do something
        Install something
    </div>
    <TutorialCode/>
    
</TutorialStep>
<TutorialStep stepNumber="5">
    <div>
        Do something
        Install something
    </div>
    <TutorialCode/>
    
</TutorialStep>
